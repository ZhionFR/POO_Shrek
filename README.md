(TODO : License)

This game is a text-based adventure game, inspired by the Colossal Cave Adventure game, written by
Will Crowther and Don Woods in the early '70s. 

This project is part of our Object-Oriented Programming course during our 3rd year of degree.

Tips
-----------

Here are some tips that can help you during your adventure:

1. Make a map on a piece of paper (or similar), 
   and write down all the rooms with objects you can interact with in there.
   Doing so, you will be able to tell which directions you have tried or haven't. 
2. Use the different images that are available to you in the image folder. 
   These images are primarily used to let you know how the rooms you are in are arranged. 
   This can be useful if you need to take/use an object.
3. Save the game every half hour or so, using the `save` command.
   Start with `load save` next time to resume from where you were. 
4. Don't be shy to use every command everywhere, 
   you will at a certain point be able to do something maybe unexpected.
5. Have fun! This is only an University project. 
   The aim is to offer a lit bit of fun on an old-style game.

**Note:** Sometimes you will have to use two word (verb-noun) commands,
and sometimes only single word (verb) commands.
To know which one will be appropriate, you can always go to the documentation available.
