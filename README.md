Tips
-----------

Here are some tips that can help you during your adventure:

1. Make a map on a piece of paper (or similar), 
   and write down all the rooms with objects you can interact with in there.
   Doing so, you will be able to tell which directions you have tried or haven't. 
2. Use the different images that are available to you in the image folder. 
   These images are primarily used to let you know how the rooms you are in are arranged. 
   This can be useful if you need to take/use an object.
4. Don't be shy to use every command everywhere, 
   you will at a certain point be able to do something maybe unexpected.
5. Have fun! This is only an University project. 
   The aim is to offer a lit bit of fun on an old-style game.

**Note:** Sometimes you will have to use words capitalized in the text as commands to continue.
